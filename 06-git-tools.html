You've accomplished the basic tasks of tracking and committing files, and you've harnessed the power of the staging area and lightweight topic branching and merging.</p> <p>Now you'll explore a number of very powerful things that Git can do that you may not necessarily use on a day-to-day basis but that you may need at some point.</p> <h2 id="revision-selection">Revision Selection</h2> <p>Git allows you to specify specific commits or a range of commits in several ways.

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>In this case, choose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">1c002dd....</code> If you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git show</code> that commit, the following commands are equivalent (assuming the shorter versions are unambiguous):</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git show 1c002dd4b536e7479fe34593e72e6c6c1819e53b
$ git show 1c002dd4b536e7479f
$ git show 1c002d
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Git can figure out a short, unique abbreviation for your SHA-1 values. If you pass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--abbrev-commit</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git log</code> command, the output will use shorter values but keep them unique; it defaults to using seven characters but makes them longer if necessary to keep the SHA-1 unambiguous:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline
ca82a6d changed the version number
085bb3b removed unnecessary test code
a11bef0 first commit
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Generally, eight to ten characters are more than enough to be unique within a project. One of the largest Git projects, the Linux kernel, is beginning to need 12 characters out of the possible 40 to stay unique.</p> <h3 id="a-short-note-about-sha-1">A SHORT NOTE ABOUT SHA-1</h3> <p>A lot of people become concerned at some point that they will, by random happenstance, have two objects in their repository that hash to the same SHA-1 value. What then?</p> <p>If you do happen to commit an object that hashes to the same SHA-1 value as a previous object in your repository, Git will see the previous object already in your Git database and assume it was already written. If you try to check out that object again at some point, you'll always get the data of the first object.</p> <p>However, you should be aware of how ridiculously unlikely this scenario is. The SHA-1 digest is 20 bytes or 160 bits. The number of randomly hashed objects needed to ensure a 50% probability of a single collision is about 2^80 (the formula for determining collision probability is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">p = (n(n-1)/2) * (1/2^160)</code>). 2^80 is 1.2 x 10^24 or 1 million billion billion. That's 1,200 times the number of grains of sand on the earth.</p> <p>Here's an example to give you an idea of what it would take to get a SHA-1 collision. If all 6.5 billion humans on Earth were programming, and every second, each one was producing code that was the equivalent of the entire Linux kernel history (1 million Git objects) and pushing it into one enormous Git repository, it would take 5 years until that repository contained enough objects to have a 50% probability of a single SHA-1 object collision. A higher probability exists that every member of your programming team will be attacked and killed by wolves in unrelated incidents on the same night.</p> <h3 id="branch-references">Branch References</h3> <p>The most straightforward way to specify a commit requires that it have a branch reference pointed at it. Then, you can use a branch name in any Git command that expects a commit object or SHA-1 value. For instance, if you want to show the last commit object on a branch, the following commands are equivalent, assuming that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">topic1</code> branch points to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">ca82a6d</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git show ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949
$ git show topic1
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If you want to see which specific SHA a branch points to, or if you want to see what any of these examples boils down to in terms of SHAs, you can use a Git plumbing tool called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rev-parse</code>. You can see Chapter 9 for more information about plumbing tools; basically, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rev-parse</code> exists for lower-level operations and isn't designed to be used in day-to-day operations. However, it can be helpful sometimes when you need to see what's really going on. Here you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rev-parse</code> on your branch.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git rev-parse topic1
ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949
</code></pre>  </div></div> <h3 id="reflog-shortnames">RefLog Shortnames</h3> <p>One of the things Git does in the background while you're working away is keep a reflog — a log of where your HEAD and branch references have been for the last few months.</p> <p>You can see your reflog by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git reflog</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git reflog
734713b HEAD@{0}: commit: fixed refs handling, added gc auto, updated
d921970 HEAD@{1}: merge phedders/rdocs: Merge made by recursive.

1c36188 HEAD@{3}: rebase -i (squash): updating HEAD
95df984 HEAD@{4}: commit: # This is a combination of two commits.
1c36188 HEAD@{5}: rebase -i (squash): updating HEAD
7e05da5 HEAD@{6}: rebase -i (pick): updating HEAD
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Every time your branch tip is updated for any reason, Git stores that information for you in this temporary history. And you can specify older commits with this data, as well. If you want to see the fifth prior value of the HEAD of your repository, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">@{n}</code> reference that you see in the reflog output:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git show HEAD@{5}
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You can also use this syntax to see where a branch was some specific amount of time ago. For instance, to see where your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch was yesterday, you can type</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git show master@{yesterday}
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>That shows you where the branch tip was yesterday. This technique only works for data that's still in your reflog, so you can't use it to look for commits older than a few months.</p> <p>To see reflog information formatted like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git log</code> output, you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git log -g</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log -g master

    Merge commit 'phedders/rdocs'
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>It's important to note that the reflog information is strictly local — it's a log of what you've done in your repository. The references won't be the same on someone else's copy of the repository; and right after you initially clone a repository, you'll have an empty reflog, as no activity has occurred yet in your repository. Running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git show HEAD@{2.months.ago}</code> will work only if you cloned the project at least two months ago — if you cloned it five minutes ago, you'll get no results.</p> <h3 id="ancestry-references">Ancestry References</h3> <p>The other main way to specify a commit is via its ancestry. If you place a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">^</code> at the end of a reference, Git resolves it to mean the parent of that commit. Suppose you look at the history of your project:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log --pretty=format:'%h %s' --graph

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Then, you can see the previous commit by specifying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">HEAD^</code>, which means "the parent of HEAD":</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git show HEAD^

    Merge commit 'phedders/rdocs'
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You can also specify a number after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">^</code> — for example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">d921970^2</code> means "the second parent of d921970." This syntax is only useful for merge commits, which have more than one parent. The first parent is the branch you were on when you merged, and the second is the commit on the branch that you merged in:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git show d921970^

    Some rdoc changes
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>The other main ancestry specification is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">~</code>. This also refers to the first parent, so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">HEAD~</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">HEAD^</code> are equivalent. The difference becomes apparent when you specify a number. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">HEAD~2</code> means "the first parent of the first parent," or "the grandparent" — it traverses the first parents the number of times you specify. For example, in the history listed earlier, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">HEAD~3</code> would be</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git show HEAD~3

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This can also be written <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">HEAD^^^</code>, which again is the first parent of the first parent of the first parent:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git show HEAD^^^
commit 1c3618887afb5fbcbea25b7c013f4e2114448b8d

Date:   Fri Nov 7 13:47:59 2008 -0500

    ignore *.gem
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You can also combine these syntaxes — you can get the second parent of the previous reference (assuming it was a merge commit) by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">HEAD~3^2</code>, and so on.</p> <h3 id="commit-ranges">Commit Ranges</h3> <p>Now that you can specify individual commits, let's see how to specify ranges of commits. This is particularly useful for managing your branches — if you have a lot of branches, you can use range specifications to answer questions such as, "What work is on this branch that I haven't yet merged into my main branch?"</p> <h4 id="double-dot">Double Dot</h4> <p>The most common range specification is the double-dot syntax. This basically asks Git to resolve a range of commits that are reachable from one commit but aren't reachable from another. For example, say you have a commit history that looks like Figure 6-1.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0601.png Figure 6-1. Example history for range selection.</p> <p>You want to see what is in your experiment branch that hasn't yet been merged into your master branch. You can ask Git to show you a log of just those commits with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master..experiment</code> — that means "all commits reachable by experiment that aren't reachable by master." For the sake of brevity and clarity in these examples, I'll use the letters of the commit objects from the diagram in place of the actual log output in the order that they would display:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log master..experiment
D
C
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If, on the other hand, you want to see the opposite — all commits in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> that aren't in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">experiment</code> — you can reverse the branch names. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">experiment..master</code> shows you everything in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> not reachable from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">experiment</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log experiment..master
F
E
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This is useful if you want to keep the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">experiment</code> branch up to date and preview what you're about to merge in. Another very frequent use of this syntax is to see what you're about to push to a remote:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log origin/master..HEAD
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This command shows you any commits in your current branch that aren't in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch on your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">origin</code> remote. If you run a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git push</code> and your current branch is tracking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">origin/master</code>, the commits listed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git log origin/master..HEAD</code> are the commits that will be transferred to the server. You can also leave off one side of the syntax to have Git assume HEAD. For example, you can get the same results as in the previous example by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git log origin/master..</code> — Git substitutes HEAD if one side is missing.</p> <h4 id="multiple-points">Multiple Points</h4> <p>The double-dot syntax is useful as a shorthand; but perhaps you want to specify more than two branches to indicate your revision, such as seeing what commits are in any of several branches that aren't in the branch you're currently on. Git allows you to do this by using either the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">^</code> character or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--not</code> before any reference from which you don't want to see reachable commits. Thus these three commands are equivalent:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log refA..refB
$ git log ^refA refB
$ git log refB --not refA
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This is nice because with this syntax you can specify more than two references in your query, which you cannot do with the double-dot syntax. For instance, if you want to see all commits that are reachable from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">refA</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">refB</code> but not from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">refC</code>, you can type one of these:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log refA refB ^refC
$ git log refA refB --not refC
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This makes for a very powerful revision query system that should help you figure out what is in your branches.</p> <h4 id="triple-dot">Triple Dot</h4> <p>The last major range-selection syntax is the triple-dot syntax, which specifies all the commits that are reachable by either of two references but not by both of them. Look back at the example commit history in Figure 6-1. If you want to see what is in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">experiment</code> but not any common references, you can run</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log master...experiment
F
E
D
C
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Again, this gives you normal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">log</code> output but shows you only the commit information for those four commits, appearing in the traditional commit date ordering.</p> <p>A common switch to use with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">log</code> command in this case is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--left-right</code>, which shows you which side of the range each commit is in. This helps make the data more useful:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log --left-right master...experiment
&lt; F
&lt; E
&gt; D
&gt; C
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>With these tools, you can much more easily let Git know what commit or commits you want to inspect.</p> <h2 id="interactive-staging">Interactive Staging</h2> <p>Git comes with a couple of scripts that make some command-line tasks easier. Here, you'll look at a few interactive commands that can help you easily craft your commits to include only certain combinations and parts of files. These tools are very helpful if you modify a bunch of files and then decide that you want those changes to be in several focused commits rather than one big messy commit. This way, you can make sure your commits are logically separate changesets and can be easily reviewed by the developers working with you. If you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git add</code> with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-i</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--interactive</code> option, Git goes into an interactive shell mode, displaying something like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git add -i

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>The status of the simplegit.rb file is interesting. It shows you that a couple of lines are staged and a couple are unstaged. You've partially staged this file. At this point, you can exit the interactive adding script and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git commit</code> to commit the partially staged files.</p> <p>Finally, you don't need to be in interactive add mode to do the partial-file staging — you can start the same script by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git add -p</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git add --patch</code> on the command line.</p> <h2 id="stashing">Stashing</h2> <p>Often, when you've been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want to switch branches for a bit to work on something else. The problem is, you don't want to do a commit of half-done work just so you can get back to this point later. The answer to this issue is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git stash</code> command.</p> <p>Stashing takes the dirty state of your working directory — that is, your modified tracked files and staged changes — and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.</p> <h3 id="stashing-your-work">Stashing Your Work</h3> <p>To demonstrate, you'll go into your project and start working on a couple of files and possibly stage one of the changes. If you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git status</code>, you can see your dirty state:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#      modified:   index.html
#
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#
#      modified:   lib/simplegit.rb
#
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Now you want to switch branches, but you don't want to commit what you've been working on yet; so you'll stash the changes. To push a new stash onto your stack, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git stash</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state \
  "WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file"
HEAD is now at 049d078 added the index file
(To restore them type "git stash apply")
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Your working directory is clean:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>At this point, you can easily switch branches and do work elsewhere; your changes are stored on your stack. To see which stashes you've stored, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git stash list</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file
stash@{1}: WIP on master: c264051 Revert "added file_size"
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 21d80a5 added number to log
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>In this case, two stashes were done previously, so you have access to three different stashed works. You can reapply the one you just stashed by using the command shown in the help output of the original stash command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git stash apply</code>. If you want to apply one of the older stashes, you can specify it by naming it, like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git stash apply stash@{2}</code>. If you don't specify a stash, Git assumes the most recent stash and tries to apply it:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git stash apply
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#
#      modified:   index.html
#      modified:   lib/simplegit.rb
#
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You can see that Git re-modifies the files you uncommitted when you saved the stash. In this case, you had a clean working directory when you tried to apply the stash, and you tried to apply it on the same branch you saved it from; but having a clean working directory and applying it on the same branch aren't necessary to successfully apply a stash. You can save a stash on one branch, switch to another branch later, and try to reapply the changes. You can also have modified and uncommitted files in your working directory when you apply a stash — Git gives you merge conflicts if anything no longer applies cleanly.</p> <p>The changes to your files were reapplied, but the file you staged before wasn't restaged. To do that, you must run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git stash apply</code> command with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--index</code> option to tell the command to try to reapply the staged changes. If you had run that instead, you'd have gotten back to your original position:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git stash apply --index
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#      modified:   index.html
#
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#
#      modified:   lib/simplegit.rb
#
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>The apply option only tries to apply the stashed work — you continue to have it on your stack. To remove it, you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git stash drop</code> with the name of the stash to remove:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file
stash@{1}: WIP on master: c264051 Revert "added file_size"
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 21d80a5 added number to log
$ git stash drop stash@{0}

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You can also run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git stash pop</code> to apply the stash and then immediately drop it from your stack.</p> <h3 id="un-applying-a-stash">Un-applying a Stash</h3> <p>In some use case scenarios you might want to apply stashed changes, do some work, but then un-apply those changes that originally came from the stash. Git does not provide such a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">stash unapply</code> command, but it is possible to achieve the effect by simply retrieving the patch associated with a stash and applying it in reverse:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git stash show -p stash@{0} | git apply -R
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Again, if you don't specify a stash, Git assumes the most recent stash:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git stash show -p | git apply -R
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You may want to create an alias and effectively add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">stash-unapply</code> command to your Git. For example:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git config --global alias.stash-unapply '!git stash show -p | git apply -R'
$ git stash apply
$ #... work work work
$ git stash-unapply
</code></pre>  </div></div> <h3 id="creating-a-branch-from-a-stash">Creating a Branch from a Stash</h3> <p>If you stash some work, leave it there for a while, and continue on the branch from which you stashed the work, you may have a problem reapplying the work. If the apply tries to modify a file that you've since modified, you'll get a merge conflict and will have to try to resolve it. If you want an easier way to test the stashed changes again, you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git stash branch</code>, which creates a new branch for you, checks out the commit you were on when you stashed your work, reapplies your work there, and then drops the stash if it applies successfully:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git stash branch testchanges
Switched to a new branch "testchanges"

# Changes not staged for commit:

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This is a nice shortcut to recover stashed work easily and work on it in a new branch.</p> <h2 id="rewriting-history">Rewriting History</h2> <p>Many times, when working with Git, you may want to revise your commit history for some reason. One of the great things about Git is that it allows you to make decisions at the last possible moment. You can decide what files go into which commits right before you commit with the staging area, you can decide that you didn't mean to be working on something yet with the stash command, and you can rewrite commits that already happened so they look like they happened in a different way. This can involve changing the order of the commits, changing messages or modifying files in a commit, squashing together or splitting apart commits, or removing commits entirely — all before you share your work with others.</p> <p>In this section, you'll cover how to accomplish these very useful tasks so that you can make your commit history look the way you want before you share it with others.</p> <h3 id="changing-the-last-commit">Changing the Last Commit</h3> <p>Changing your last commit is probably the most common rewriting of history that you'll do. You'll often want to do two basic things to your last commit: change the commit message, or change the snapshot you just recorded by adding, changing and removing files.</p> <p>If you only want to modify your last commit message, it's very simple:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git commit --amend
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>That drops you into your text editor, which has your last commit message in it, ready for you to modify the message. When you save and close the editor, the editor writes a new commit containing that message and makes it your new last commit.</p> <p>If you've committed and then you want to change the snapshot you committed by adding or changing files, possibly because you forgot to add a newly created file when you originally committed, the process works basically the same way. You stage the changes you want by editing a file and running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git add</code> on it or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git rm</code> to a tracked file, and the subsequent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git commit --amend</code> takes your current staging area and makes it the snapshot for the new commit.</p> <p>You need to be careful with this technique because amending changes the SHA-1 of the commit. It's like a very small rebase — don't amend your last commit if you've already pushed it.</p> <h3 id="changing-multiple-commit-messages">Changing Multiple Commit Messages</h3> <p>To modify a commit that is farther back in your history, you must move to more complex tools. Git doesn't have a modify-history tool, but you can use the rebase tool to rebase a series of commits onto the HEAD they were originally based on instead of moving them to another one. With the interactive rebase tool, you can then stop after each commit you want to modify and change the message, add files, or do whatever you wish. You can run rebase interactively by adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-i</code> option to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git rebase</code>. You must indicate how far back you want to rewrite commits by telling the command which commit to rebase onto.</p> <p>For example, if you want to change the last three commit messages, or any of the commit messages in that group, you supply as an argument to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git rebase -i</code> the parent of the last commit you want to edit, which is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">HEAD~2^</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">HEAD~3</code>. It may be easier to remember the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">~3</code> because you're trying to edit the last three commits; but keep in mind that you're actually designating four commits ago, the parent of the last commit you want to edit:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git rebase -i HEAD~3
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Remember again that this is a rebasing command — every commit included in the range <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">HEAD~3..HEAD</code> will be rewritten, whether you change the message or not. Don't include any commit you've already pushed to a central server — doing so will confuse other developers by providing an alternate version of the same change.</p> <p>Running this command gives you a list of commits in your text editor that looks something like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame

# Note that empty commits are commented out
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>It's important to note that these commits are listed in the opposite order than you normally see them using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">log</code> command. If you run a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">log</code>, you see something like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" HEAD~3..HEAD
a5f4a0d added cat-file
310154e updated README formatting and added blame
f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Notice the reverse order. The interactive rebase gives you a script that it's going to run. It will start at the commit you specify on the command line (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">HEAD~3</code>) and replay the changes introduced in each of these commits from top to bottom. It lists the oldest at the top, rather than the newest, because that's the first one it will replay.</p> <p>You need to edit the script so that it stops at the commit you want to edit. To do so, change the word pick to the word edit for each of the commits you want the script to stop after. For example, to modify only the third commit message, you change the file to look like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>edit f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds you back to the last commit in that list and drops you on the command line with the following message:</p> <!-- This is actually weird, as the SHA-1 of 7482e0d is not present in the list, nor is the commit message. Please review --> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git rebase -i HEAD~3
Stopped at 7482e0d... updated the gemspec to hopefully work better
You can amend the commit now, with

       git commit --amend

Once you're satisfied with your changes, run

       git rebase --continue
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>These instructions tell you exactly what to do. Type</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git commit --amend
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Change the commit message, and exit the editor. Then, run</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git rebase --continue
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This command will apply the other two commits automatically, and then you're done. If you change pick to edit on more lines, you can repeat these steps for each commit you change to edit. Each time, Git will stop, let you amend the commit, and continue when you're finished.</p> <h3 id="reordering-commits">Reordering Commits</h3> <p>You can also use interactive rebases to reorder or remove commits entirely. If you want to remove the "added cat-file" commit and change the order in which the other two commits are introduced, you can change the rebase script from this</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>to this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds your branch to the parent of these commits, applies <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">310154e</code> and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">f7f3f6d</code>, and then stops. You effectively change the order of those commits and remove the "added cat-file" commit completely.</p> <h3 id="squashing-commits">Squashing Commits</h3> <p>It's also possible to take a series of commits and squash them down into a single commit with the interactive rebasing tool. The script puts helpful instructions in the rebase message:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If, instead of "pick" or "edit", you specify "squash", Git applies both that change and the change directly before it and makes you merge the commit messages together. So, if you want to make a single commit from these three commits, you make the script look like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
squash 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
squash a5f4a0d added cat-file
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>When you save and exit the editor, Git applies all three changes and then puts you back into the editor to merge the three commit messages:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># This is a combination of 3 commits.
# The first commit's message is:
changed my name a bit

# This is the 2nd commit message:

updated README formatting and added blame

# This is the 3rd commit message:

added cat-file
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>When you save that, you have a single commit that introduces the changes of all three previous commits.</p> <h3 id="splitting-a-commit">Splitting a Commit</h3> <p>Splitting a commit undoes a commit and then partially stages and commits as many times as commits you want to end up with. For example, suppose you want to split the middle commit of your three commits. Instead of "updated README formatting and added blame", you want to split it into two commits: "updated README formatting" for the first, and "added blame" for the second. You can do that in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rebase -i</code> script by changing the instruction on the commit you want to split to "edit":</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
edit 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds to the parent of the first commit in your list, applies the first commit (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">f7f3f6d</code>), applies the second (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">310154e</code>), and drops you to the console. There, you can do a mixed reset of that commit with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git reset HEAD^</code>, which effectively undoes that commit and leaves the modified files unstaged. Now you can take the changes that have been reset, and create multiple commits out of them. Simply stage and commit files until you have several commits, and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git rebase --continue</code> when you're done:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git reset HEAD^
$ git add README
$ git commit -m 'updated README formatting'
$ git add lib/simplegit.rb
$ git commit -m 'added blame'
$ git rebase --continue
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Git applies the last commit (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">a5f4a0d</code>) in the script, and your history looks like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log -4 --pretty=format:"%h %s"
1c002dd added cat-file
9b29157 added blame
35cfb2b updated README formatting
f3cc40e changed my name a bit
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Once again, this changes the SHAs of all the commits in your list, so make sure no commit shows up in that list that you've already pushed to a shared repository.</p> <h3 id="the-nuclear-option-filter-branch">The Nuclear Option: filter-branch</h3> <p>There is another history-rewriting option that you can use if you need to rewrite a larger number of commits in some scriptable way — for instance, changing your e-mail address globally or removing a file from every commit. The command is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">filter-branch</code>, and it can rewrite huge swaths of your history, so you probably shouldn't use it unless your project isn't yet public and other people haven't based work off the commits you're about to rewrite. However, it can be very useful. You'll learn a few of the common uses so you can get an idea of some of the things it's capable of.</p> <h4 id="removing-a-file-from-every-commit">Removing a File from Every Commit</h4> <p>This occurs fairly commonly. Someone accidentally commits a huge binary file with a thoughtless <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git add .</code>, and you want to remove it everywhere. Perhaps you accidentally committed a file that contained a password, and you want to make your project open source. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">filter-branch</code> is the tool you probably want to use to scrub your entire history. To remove a file named passwords.txt from your entire history, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--tree-filter</code> option to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">filter-branch</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' HEAD
Rewrite 6b9b3cf04e7c5686a9cb838c3f36a8cb6a0fc2bd (21/21)
Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--tree-filter</code> option runs the specified command after each checkout of the project and then recommits the results. In this case, you remove a file called passwords.txt from every snapshot, whether it exists or not. If you want to remove all accidentally committed editor backup files, you can run something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git filter-branch --tree-filter "rm -f *~" HEAD</code>.</p> <p>You'll be able to watch Git rewriting trees and commits and then move the branch pointer at the end. It's generally a good idea to do this in a testing branch and then hard-reset your master branch after you've determined the outcome is what you really want. To run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">filter-branch</code> on all your branches, you can pass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--all</code> to the command.</p> <h4 id="making-a-subdirectory-the-new-root">Making a Subdirectory the New Root</h4> <p>Suppose you've done an import from another source control system and have subdirectories that make no sense (trunk, tags, and so on). If you want to make the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">trunk</code> subdirectory be the new project root for every commit, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">filter-branch</code> can help you do that, too:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter trunk HEAD
Rewrite 856f0bf61e41a27326cdae8f09fe708d679f596f (12/12)
Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Now your new project root is what was in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">trunk</code> subdirectory each time. Git will also automatically remove commits that did not affect the subdirectory.</p> <h4 id="changing-e-mail-addresses-globally">Changing E-Mail Addresses Globally</h4> <p>Another common case is that you forgot to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git config</code> to set your name and e-mail address before you started working, or perhaps you want to open-source a project at work and change all your work e-mail addresses to your personal address. In any case, you can change e-mail addresses in multiple commits in a batch with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">filter-branch</code> as well. You need to be careful to change only the e-mail addresses that are yours, so you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--commit-filter</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git filter-branch --commit-filter '
        if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "schacon@localhost" ];
        then
                GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Scott Chacon";
                GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="schacon@example.com";
                git commit-tree "$@";
        else
                git commit-tree "$@";
        fi' HEAD
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This goes through and rewrites every commit to have your new address. Because commits contain the SHA-1 values of their parents, this command changes every commit SHA in your history, not just those that have the matching e-mail address.</p> <h3 id="the-very-fast-nuclear-option-big-friendly-giant-repo-cleaner-bfg">The Very Fast Nuclear Option: Big Friendly Giant Repo Cleaner (BFG)</h3> <p><a href="https://github.com/rtyley">Roberto Tyley</a> has written a similar tool to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">filter-branch</code> called the BFG. BFG cannot do as much as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">filter-branch</code>, but it is <em>very</em> fast and on a large repository this can make a big difference. If the change you want to make is in the scope of BFG capability, and you have performance issues, then you should consider using it.</p> <p>See the <a href="http://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/">BFG</a> website for details.</p> <h2 id="debugging-with-git">Debugging with Git</h2> <p>Git also provides a couple of tools to help you debug issues in your projects. Because Git is designed to work with nearly any type of project, these tools are pretty generic, but they can often help you hunt for a bug or culprit when things go wrong.</p> <h3 id="file-annotation">File Annotation</h3> <p>If you track down a bug in your code and want to know when it was introduced and why, file annotation is often your best tool. It shows you what commit was the last to modify each line of any file. So, if you see that a method in your code is buggy, you can annotate the file with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git blame</code> to see when each line of the method was last edited and by whom. This example uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-L</code> option to limit the output to lines 12 through 22:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git blame -L 12,22 simplegit.rb

^4832fe2 (Scott Chacon  2008-03-15 10:31:28 -0700 13)   command("git show #{tree}")

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Notice that the first field is the partial SHA-1 of the commit that last modified that line. The next two fields are values extracted from that commit—the author name and the authored date of that commit — so you can easily see who modified that line and when. After that come the line number and the content of the file. Also note the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">^4832fe2</code> commit lines, which designate that those lines were in this file's original commit. That commit is when this file was first added to this project, and those lines have been unchanged since. This is a tad confusing, because now you've seen at least three different ways that Git uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">^</code> to modify a commit SHA, but that is what it means here.</p> <p>Another cool thing about Git is that it doesn't track file renames explicitly. It records the snapshots and then tries to figure out what was renamed implicitly, after the fact. One of the interesting features of this is that you can ask it to figure out all sorts of code movement as well. If you pass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-C</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git blame</code>, Git analyzes the file you're annotating and tries to figure out where snippets of code within it originally came from if they were copied from elsewhere. Recently, I was refactoring a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">GITServerHandler.m</code> into multiple files, one of which was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">GITPackUpload.m</code>. By blaming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">GITPackUpload.m</code> with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-C</code> option, I could see where sections of the code originally came from:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git blame -C -L 141,153 GITPackUpload.m

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This is really useful. Normally, you get as the original commit the commit where you copied the code over, because that is the first time you touched those lines in this file. Git tells you the original commit where you wrote those lines, even if it was in another file.</p> <h3 id="binary-search">Binary Search</h3> <p>Annotating a file helps if you know where the issue is to begin with. If you don't know what is breaking, and there have been dozens or hundreds of commits since the last state where you know the code worked, you'll likely turn to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git bisect</code> for help. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">bisect</code> command does a binary search through your commit history to help you identify as quickly as possible which commit introduced an issue.</p> <p>Let's say you just pushed out a release of your code to a production environment, you're getting bug reports about something that wasn't happening in your development environment, and you can't imagine why the code is doing that. You go back to your code, and it turns out you can reproduce the issue, but you can't figure out what is going wrong. You can bisect the code to find out. First you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git bisect start</code> to get things going, and then you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git bisect bad</code> to tell the system that the current commit you're on is broken. Then, you must tell bisect when the last known good state was, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git bisect good [good_commit]</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git bisect start

If it does, then it was introduced sometime before this middle commit; if it doesn't, then the problem was introduced sometime after the middle commit.

In fact, if you have a script that will exit 0 if the project is good or non-0 if the project is bad, you can fully automate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git bisect</code>. First, you again tell it the scope of the bisect by providing the known bad and good commits. You can do this by listing them with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">bisect start</code> command if you want, listing the known bad commit first and the known good commit second:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git bisect start HEAD v1.0
$ git bisect run test-error.sh
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Doing so automatically runs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">test-error.sh</code> on each checked-out commit until Git finds the first broken commit. You can also run something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">make</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">make tests</code> or whatever you have that runs automated tests for you.</p> <h2 id="submodules">Submodules</h2> <p>It often happens that while working on one project, you need to use another project from within it. Perhaps it's a library that a third party developed or that you're developing separately and using in multiple parent projects. A common issue arises in these scenarios: you want to be able to treat the two projects as separate yet still be able to use one from within the other.</p> <p>Here's an example. Suppose you're developing a web site and creating Atom feeds. Instead of writing your own Atom-generating code, you decide to use a library. You're likely to have to either include this code from a shared library like a CPAN install or Ruby gem, or copy the source code into your own project tree. The issue with including the library is that it's difficult to customize the library in any way and often more difficult to deploy it, because you need to make sure every client has that library available. The issue with vendoring the code into your own project is that any custom changes you make are difficult to merge when upstream changes become available.</p> <p>Git addresses this issue using submodules. Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.</p> <h3 id="starting-with-submodules">Starting with Submodules</h3> <p>Suppose you want to add the Rack library (a Ruby web server gateway interface) to your project, possibly maintain your own changes to it, but continue to merge in upstream changes. The first thing you should do is clone the external repository into your subdirectory. You add external projects as submodules with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git submodule add</code> command:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git submodule add git://github.com/chneukirchen/rack.git rack

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Now you have the Rack project under a subdirectory named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack</code> within your project. You can go into that subdirectory, make changes, add your own writable remote repository to push your changes into, fetch and merge from the original repository, and more. If you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git status</code> right after you add the submodule, you see two things:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git status

#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#      new file:   .gitmodules
#      new file:   rack
#
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>First you notice the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">.gitmodules</code> file. This is a configuration file that stores the mapping between the project's URL and the local subdirectory you've pulled it into:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cat .gitmodules
[submodule "rack"]
      path = rack
      url = git://github.com/chneukirchen/rack.git
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If you have multiple submodules, you'll have multiple entries in this file. It's important to note that this file is version-controlled with your other files, like your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">.gitignore</code> file. It's pushed and pulled with the rest of your project. This is how other people who clone this project know where to get the submodule projects from.</p> <p>The other listing in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git status</code> output is the rack entry. If you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git diff</code> on that, you see something interesting:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git diff --cached rack

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Although <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack</code> is a subdirectory in your working directory, Git sees it as a submodule and doesn't track its contents when you're not in that directory. Instead, Git records it as a particular commit from that repository. When you make changes and commit in that subdirectory, the superproject notices that the HEAD there has changed and records the exact commit you're currently working off of; that way, when others clone this project, they can re-create the environment exactly.</p> <p>This is an important point with submodules: you record them as the exact commit they're at. You can't record a submodule at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> or some other symbolic reference.</p> <p>When you commit, you see something like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git commit -m 'first commit with submodule rack'

That is a special mode in Git that basically means you're recording a commit as a directory entry rather than a subdirectory or a file.</p> <p>You can treat the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack</code> directory as a separate project and then update your superproject from time to time with a pointer to the latest commit in that subproject.

It's strange, but it works.</p> <p>One common problem happens when a developer makes a change locally in a submodule but doesn't push it to a public server.

    added a submodule reference I will never make public. hahahahaha!
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Then, you e-mail that guy and yell at him.</p> <h3 id="superprojects">Superprojects</h3> <p>Sometimes, developers want to get a combination of a large project's subdirectories, depending on what team they're on. This is common if you're coming from CVS or Subversion, where you've defined a module or collection of subdirectories, and you want to keep this type of workflow.</p> <p>A good way to do this in Git is to make each of the subdirectories a separate Git repository and then create superproject Git repositories that contain multiple submodules. A benefit of this approach is that you can more specifically define the relationships between the projects with tags and branches in the superprojects.</p> <h3 id="issues-with-submodules">Issues with Submodules</h3> <p>Using submodules isn't without hiccups, however. First, you must be relatively careful when working in the submodule directory. When you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git submodule update</code>, it checks out the specific version of the project, but not within a branch. This is called having a detached HEAD — it means the HEAD file points directly to a commit, not to a symbolic reference. The issue is that you generally don't want to work in a detached HEAD environment, because it's easy to lose changes. If you do an initial <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">submodule update</code>, commit in that submodule directory without creating a branch to work in, and then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git submodule update</code> again from the superproject without committing in the meantime, Git will overwrite your changes without telling you. Technically you won't lose the work, but you won't have a branch pointing to it, so it will be somewhat difficult to retrieve.</p> <p>To avoid this issue, create a branch when you work in a submodule directory with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git checkout -b work</code> or something equivalent. When you do the submodule update a second time, it will still revert your work, but at least you have a pointer to get back to.</p> <p>Switching branches with submodules in them can also be tricky. If you create a new branch, add a submodule there, and then switch back to a branch without that submodule, you still have the submodule directory as an untracked directory:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git checkout -b rack

$ git submodule add git@github.com:schacon/rack.git rack

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You have to either move it out of the way or remove it, in which case you have to clone it again when you switch back—and you may lose local changes or branches that you didn't push up.</p> <p>The last main caveat that many people run into involves switching from subdirectories to submodules. If you've been tracking files in your project and you want to move them out into a submodule, you must be careful or Git will get angry at you. Assume that you have the rack files in a subdirectory of your project, and you want to switch it to a submodule. If you delete the subdirectory and then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">submodule add</code>, Git yells at you:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ rm -Rf rack/
$ git submodule add git@github.com:schacon/rack.git rack
'rack' already exists in the index
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You have to unstage the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack</code> directory first. Then you can add the submodule:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git rm -r rack

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Now suppose you did that in a branch. If you try to switch back to a branch where those files are still in the actual tree rather than a submodule — you get this error:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git checkout master
error: Untracked working tree file 'rack/AUTHORS' would be overwritten by merge.
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You have to move the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack</code> submodule directory out of the way before you can switch to a branch that doesn't have it:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ mv rack /tmp/
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch "master"
$ ls
README	rack
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Then, when you switch back, you get an empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack</code> directory. You can either run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git submodule update</code> to reclone, or you can move your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">/tmp/rack</code> directory back into the empty directory.</p> <h2 id="subtree-merging">Subtree Merging</h2> <p>Now that you've seen the difficulties of the submodule system, let's look at an alternate way to solve the same problem. When Git merges, it looks at what it has to merge together and then chooses an appropriate merging strategy to use. If you're merging two branches, Git uses a <em>recursive</em> strategy. If you're merging more than two branches, Git picks the <em>octopus</em> strategy. These strategies are automatically chosen for you because the recursive strategy can handle complex three-way merge situations — for example, more than one common ancestor — but it can only handle merging two branches. The octopus merge can handle multiple branches but is more cautious to avoid difficult conflicts, so it's chosen as the default strategy if you're trying to merge more than two branches.</p> <p>However, there are other strategies you can choose as well. One of them is the <em>subtree</em> merge, and you can use it to deal with the subproject issue. Here you'll see how to do the same rack embedding as in the last section, but using subtree merges instead.</p> <p>The idea of the subtree merge is that you have two projects, and one of the projects maps to a subdirectory of the other one and vice versa. When you specify a subtree merge, Git is smart enough to figure out that one is a subtree of the other and merge appropriately — it's pretty amazing.</p> <p>You first add the Rack application to your project. You add the Rack project as a remote reference in your own project and then check it out into its own branch:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git remote add rack_remote git@github.com:schacon/rack.git

If you check out one and then the other, you can see that they have different project roots:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ls

Switched to branch "master"
$ ls

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You want to pull the Rack project into your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> project as a subdirectory. You can do that in Git with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git read-tree</code>. You'll learn more about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">read-tree</code> and its friends in Chapter 9, but for now know that it reads the root tree of one branch into your current staging area and working directory. You just switched back to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch, and you pull the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack_branch</code> branch into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack</code> subdirectory of your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch of your main project:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git read-tree --prefix=rack/ -u rack_branch
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>When you commit, it looks like you have all the Rack files under that subdirectory — as though you copied them in from a tarball. What gets interesting is that you can fairly easily merge changes from one of the branches to the other. So, if the Rack project updates, you can pull in upstream changes by switching to that branch and pulling:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git checkout rack_branch
$ git pull
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Then, you can merge those changes back into your master branch. You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git merge -s subtree</code> and it will work fine; but Git will also merge the histories together, which you probably don't want. To pull in the changes and prepopulate the commit message, use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--squash</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--no-commit</code> options as well as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-s subtree</code> strategy option:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git checkout master
$ git merge --squash -s subtree --no-commit rack_branch
Squash commit -- not updating HEAD
Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>All the changes from your Rack project are merged in and ready to be committed locally. You can also do the opposite — make changes in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack</code> subdirectory of your master branch and then merge them into your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack_branch</code> branch later to submit them to the maintainers or push them upstream.</p> <p>To get a diff between what you have in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack</code> subdirectory and the code in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack_branch</code> branch — to see if you need to merge them — you can't use the normal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">diff</code> command. Instead, you must run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git diff-tree</code> with the branch you want to compare to:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git diff-tree -p rack_branch
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Or, to compare what is in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rack</code> subdirectory with what the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch on the server was the last time you fetched, you can run</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git diff-tree -p rack_remote/master
</code></pre>  </div></div> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <p>You've seen a number of advanced tools that allow you to manipulate your commits and staging area more precisely. When you notice issues, you should be able to easily figure out what commit introduced them, when, and by whom. If you want to use subprojects in your project, you've learned a few ways to accommodate those needs. At this point, you should be able to do most of the things in Git that you'll need on the command line day to day and feel comfortable doing so.</p> </div> </div> <div class="navigation-bottom d-flex flex-justify-between py-3" role="navigation" aria-label="footer navigation"> <div class="prev"><a href="/progit-book/05-distributed-git.html" class="btn" title="Distributed Git #" accesskey="p" rel="prev"> <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-left"></i> Previous </a></div> <div class="next"><a href="/progit-book/07-customizing-git.html" class="btn" title="Customizing Git #" accesskey="n" rel="next"> Next <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> </a></div> </div><hr> <div class="copyright text-center text-gray" role="contentinfo"> <a class="text-gray" href="https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#disclaimer"> <i class="fa fa-copyright"></i> <span class="time">2015-2024,</span> </a> <a class="text-gray" href="https://github.com/eq19" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> eQuantum, </a> Prime Spin <a class="text-gray" href="https://github.com/JunctionTerms/progit-book/commit/5633879a29af8bd1d6c0f4b1a149552dfc8b37c3" title="5633879a29af8bd1d6c0f4b1a149552dfc8b37c3" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">[5,4]</a> <br> <div class="generator"> Built with <a href="https://pages.github.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="github-pages v209">GitHub Pages</a> using a <a href="https://github.com/rundocs/jekyll-rtd-theme" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="jekyll-rtd-theme v2.0.10">theme</a> provided by <a href="https://github.com/rundocs" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">RunDocs</a>. </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="addons-wrap d-flex flex-column overflow-y-auto"> <div class="status d-flex flex-justify-between p-2"> <div class="title p-1"> <i class="fa fa-book"></i> eQuantum </div> <div class="branch p-1"> <span class="name"> profiles </span> <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i> </div> </div> <div class="addons d-flex flex-column height-full p-2 d-none"> <dl> <dt>GitHub</dt> <dd> <a href="https://eq19.com/" title="Homepage"> <i class="fa fa-home"></i> Homepage </a> </dd> <dd> <a href="https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io" title="Repository" target="_blank"> <i class="fa fa-github"></i> Repository </a> </dd> <dd> <a href="https://gist.github.com/eq19" title="Gist" target="_blank"> <i class="fa fa-download"></i> Gist </a> </dd> </dl> <hr> <div class="license f6 pb-2"> This <a href="/progit-book/" title="eQuantum" target="_blank">Software</a> is under the terms of <a href="https://github.com/JunctionTerms/progit-book" target="_blank">The Unlicense</a>. </div> </div> </div> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rundocs/jekyll-rtd-theme@2.0.10/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rundocs/jekyll-rtd-theme@2.0.10/assets/js/theme.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
