That is, you'll learn how to contribute code successfully to a project and make it as easy on you and the project maintainer as possible, and also how to maintain a project successfully with a number of developers contributing.</p> <h2 id="distributed-workflows">Distributed Workflows</h2> <p>Unlike Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs), the distributed nature of Git allows you to be far more flexible in how developers collaborate on projects. In centralized systems, every developer is a node working more or less equally on a central hub. In Git, however, every developer is potentially both a node and a hub — that is, every developer can both contribute code to other repositories and maintain a public repository on which others can base their work and which they can contribute to. This opens a vast range of workflow possibilities for your project and/or your team, so I'll cover a few common paradigms that take advantage of this flexibility. I'll go over the strengths and possible weaknesses of each design; you can choose a single one to use, or you can mix and match features from each.</p> <h3 id="centralized-workflow">Centralized Workflow</h3> <p>In centralized systems, there is generally a single collaboration model—the centralized workflow. One central hub, or repository, can accept code, and everyone synchronizes their work to it. A number of developers are nodes — consumers of that hub — and synchronize to that one place (see Figure 5-1).</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0501.png Figure 5-1. Centralized workflow.</p> <p>This means that if two developers clone from the hub and both make changes, the first developer to push their changes back up can do so with no problems. The second developer must merge in the first one's work before pushing changes up, so as not to overwrite the first developer's changes. This concept is true in Git as it is in Subversion (or any CVCS), and this model works perfectly in Git.</p> <p>If you have a small team or are already comfortable with a centralized workflow in your company or team, you can easily continue using that workflow with Git. Simply set up a single repository, and give everyone on your team push access; Git won't let users overwrite each other. If one developer clones, makes changes, and then tries to push their changes while another developer has pushed in the meantime, the server will reject that developer's changes. They will be told that they're trying to push non-fast-forward changes and that they won't be able to do so until they fetch and merge. This workflow is attractive to a lot of people because it's a paradigm that many are familiar and comfortable with.</p> <h3 id="integration-manager-workflow">Integration-Manager Workflow</h3> <p>Because Git allows you to have multiple remote repositories, it's possible to have a workflow where each developer has write access to their own public repository and read access to everyone else's. This scenario often includes a canonical repository that represents the "official" project. To contribute to that project, you create your own public clone of the project and push your changes to it. Then, you can send a request to the maintainer of the main project to pull in your changes. They can add your repository as a remote, test your changes locally, merge them into their branch, and push back to their repository. The process works as follows (see Figure 5-2):</p> <ol> <li>The project maintainer pushes to their public repository.</li> <li>A contributor clones that repository and makes changes.</li> <li>The contributor pushes to their own public copy.</li> <li>The contributor sends the maintainer an e-mail asking them to pull changes.</li> <li>The maintainer adds the contributor's repo as a remote and merges locally.</li> <li>The maintainer pushes merged changes to the main repository.</li> </ol> <p>Insert 18333fig0502.png Figure 5-2. Integration-manager workflow.</p> <p>This is a very common workflow with sites like GitHub, where it's easy to fork a project and push your changes into your fork for everyone to see. One of the main advantages of this approach is that you can continue to work, and the maintainer of the main repository can pull in your changes at any time. Contributors don't have to wait for the project to incorporate their changes — each party can work at their own pace.</p> <h3 id="dictator-and-lieutenants-workflow">Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow</h3> <p>This is a variant of a multiple-repository workflow. It's generally used by huge projects with hundreds of collaborators; one famous example is the Linux kernel. Various integration managers are in charge of certain parts of the repository; they're called lieutenants. All the lieutenants have one integration manager known as the benevolent dictator. The benevolent dictator's repository serves as the reference repository from which all the collaborators need to pull. The process works like this (see Figure 5-3):</p> <ol> <li>Regular developers work on their topic branch and rebase their work on top of master. The master branch is that of the dictator.</li> <li>Lieutenants merge the developers' topic branches into their master branch.</li> <li>The dictator merges the lieutenants' master branches into the dictator's master branch.</li> <li>The dictator pushes their master to the reference repository so the other developers can rebase on it.</li> </ol> <p>Insert 18333fig0503.png Figure 5-3. Benevolent dictator workflow.</p> <p>This kind of workflow isn't common but can be useful in very big projects or in highly hierarchical environments, as it allows the project leader (the dictator) to delegate much of the work and collect large subsets of code at multiple points before integrating them.</p> <p>These are some commonly used workflows that are possible with a distributed system like Git, but you can see that many variations are possible to suit your particular real-world workflow. Now that you can (I hope) determine which workflow combination may work for you, I'll cover some more specific examples of how to accomplish the main roles that make up the different flows.</p> <h2 id="contributing-to-a-project">Contributing to a Project</h2> <p>You know what the different workflows are, and you should have a pretty good grasp of fundamental Git usage. In this section, you'll learn about a few common patterns for contributing to a project.</p> <p>The main difficulty with describing this process is that there are a huge number of variations on how it's done. Because Git is very flexible, people can and do work together many ways, and it's problematic to describe how you should contribute to a project — every project is a bit different. Some of the variables involved are active contributor size, chosen workflow, your commit access, and possibly the external contribution method.</p> <p>The first variable is active contributor size. How many users are actively contributing code to this project, and how often? In many instances, you'll have two or three developers with a few commits a day, or possibly less for somewhat dormant projects. For really large companies or projects, the number of developers could be in the thousands, with dozens or even hundreds of patches coming in each day. This is important because with more and more developers, you run into more issues with making sure your code applies cleanly or can be easily merged. Changes you submit may be rendered obsolete or severely broken by work that is merged in while you were working or while your changes were waiting to be approved or applied. How can you keep your code consistently up to date and your patches valid?</p> <p>The next variable is the workflow in use for the project. Is it centralized, with each developer having equal write access to the main codeline? Does the project have a maintainer or integration manager who checks all the patches? Are all the patches peer-reviewed and approved? Are you involved in that process? Is a lieutenant system in place, and do you have to submit your work to them first?</p> <p>The next issue is your commit access. The workflow required in order to contribute to a project is much different if you have write access to the project than if you don't. If you don't have write access, how does the project prefer to accept contributed work? Does it even have a policy? How much work are you contributing at a time? How often do you contribute?</p> <p>All these questions can affect how you contribute effectively to a project and what workflows are preferred or available to you. I'll cover aspects of each of these in a series of use cases, moving from simple to more complex; you should be able to construct the specific workflows you need in practice from these examples.</p> <h3 id="commit-guidelines">Commit Guidelines</h3> <p>Before you start looking at the specific use cases, here's a quick note about commit messages. Having a good guideline for creating commits and sticking to it makes working with Git and collaborating with others a lot easier. The Git project provides a document that lays out a number of good tips for creating commits from which to submit patches — you can read it in the Git source code in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">Documentation/SubmittingPatches</code> file.</p> <p>First, you don't want to submit any whitespace errors. Git provides an easy way to check for this — before you commit, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git diff --check</code>, which identifies possible whitespace errors and lists them for you. Here is an example, where I've replaced a red terminal color with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">X</code>s:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git diff --check
lib/simplegit.rb:5: trailing whitespace.
+    @git_dir = File.expand_path(git_dir)XX
lib/simplegit.rb:7: trailing whitespace.
+ XXXXXXXXXXX
lib/simplegit.rb:26: trailing whitespace.
+    def command(git_cmd)XXXX
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If you run that command before committing, you can tell if you're about to commit whitespace issues that may annoy other developers.</p> <p>Next, try to make each commit a logically separate changeset. If you can, try to make your changes digestible — don't code for a whole weekend on five different issues and then submit them all as one massive commit on Monday. Even if you don't commit during the weekend, use the staging area on Monday to split your work into at least one commit per issue, with a useful message per commit. If some of the changes modify the same file, try to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git add --patch</code> to partially stage files (covered in detail in Chapter 6). The project snapshot at the tip of the branch is identical whether you do one commit or five, as long as all the changes are added at some point, so try to make things easier on your fellow developers when they have to review your changes. This approach also makes it easier to pull out or revert one of the changesets if you need to later. Chapter 6 describes a number of useful Git tricks for rewriting history and interactively staging files — use these tools to help craft a clean and understandable history.</p> <p>The last thing to keep in mind is the commit message. Getting in the habit of creating quality commit messages makes using and collaborating with Git a lot easier. As a general rule, your messages should start with a single line that's no more than about 50 characters and that describes the changeset concisely, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed explanation. The Git project requires that the more detailed explanation include your motivation for the change and contrast its implementation with previous behavior — this is a good guideline to follow. It's also a good idea to use the imperative present tense in these messages. In other words, use commands. Instead of "I added tests for" or "Adding tests for," use "Add tests for." Here is a template originally written by Tim Pope at tpope.net:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
   single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If all your commit messages look like this, things will be a lot easier for you and the developers you work with. The Git project has well-formatted commit messages — I encourage you to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git log --no-merges</code> there to see what a nicely formatted project-commit history looks like.</p> <p>In the following examples, and throughout most of this book, for the sake of brevity I don't format messages nicely like this; instead, I use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-m</code> option to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git commit</code>. Do as I say, not as I do.</p> <h3 id="private-small-team">Private Small Team</h3> <p>The simplest setup you're likely to encounter is a private project with one or two other developers. By private, I mean closed source — not read-accessible to the outside world. You and the other developers all have push access to the repository.</p> <p>In this environment, you can follow a workflow similar to what you might do when using Subversion or another centralized system. You still get the advantages of things like offline committing and vastly simpler branching and merging, but the workflow can be very similar; the main difference is that merges happen client-side rather than on the server at commit time. Let's see what it might look like when two developers start to work together with a shared repository. The first developer, John, clones the repository, makes a change, and commits locally. (I'm replacing the protocol messages with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">...</code> in these examples to shorten them somewhat.)</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">

Jessica's history after pushing all changes back to the server.</p> <p>That is one of the simplest workflows. You work for a while, generally in a topic branch, and merge into your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch when it's ready to be integrated. When you want to share that work, you merge it into your own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch, then fetch and merge <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">origin/master</code> if it has changed, and finally push to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch on the server. The general sequence is something like that shown in Figure 5-11.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0511.png Figure 5-11. General sequence of events for a simple multiple-developer Git workflow.</p> <h3 id="private-managed-team">Private Managed Team</h3> <p>In this next scenario, you'll look at contributor roles in a larger private group. You'll learn how to work in an environment where small groups collaborate on features and then those team-based contributions are integrated by another party.</p> <p>Let's say that John and Jessica are working together on one feature, while Jessica and Josie are working on a second. In this case, the company is using a type of integration-manager workflow where the work of the individual groups is integrated only by certain engineers, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch of the main repo can be updated only by those engineers. In this scenario, all work is done in team-based branches and pulled together by the integrators later.</p> <p>Let's follow Jessica's workflow as she works on her two features, collaborating in parallel with two different developers in this environment. Assuming she already has her repository cloned, she decides to work on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">featureA</code> first. She creates a new branch for the feature and does some work on it there:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code># Jessica's Machine

 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>At this point, she needs to share her work with John, so she pushes her <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">featureA</code> branch commits up to the server. Jessica doesn't have push access to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch — only the integrators do — so she has to push to another branch in order to collaborate with John:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git push origin featureA

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Jessica e-mails John to tell him that she's pushed some work into a branch named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">featureA</code> and he can look at it now. While she waits for feedback from John, Jessica decides to start working on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">featureB</code> with Josie. To begin, she starts a new feature branch, basing it off the server's <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code># Jessica's Machine

Jessica's history after committing on a feature branch.</p> <p>Jessica, Josie, and John inform the integrators that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">featureA</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">featureBee</code> branches on the server are ready for integration into the mainline. After they integrate these branches into the mainline, a fetch will bring down the new merge commits, making the commit history look like Figure 5-14.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0514.png Figure 5-14. Jessica's history after merging both her topic branches.</p> <p>Many groups switch to Git because of this ability to have multiple teams working in parallel, merging the different lines of work late in the process. The ability of smaller subgroups of a team to collaborate via remote branches without necessarily having to involve or impede the entire team is a huge benefit of Git. The sequence for the workflow you saw here is something like Figure 5-15.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0515.png Figure 5-15. Basic sequence of this managed-team workflow.</p> <h3 id="public-small-project">Public Small Project</h3> <p>Contributing to public projects is a bit different. Because you don't have the permissions to directly update branches on the project, you have to get the work to the maintainers some other way. This first example describes contributing via forking on Git hosts that support easy forking. The repo.or.cz and GitHub hosting sites both support this, and many project maintainers expect this style of contribution. The next section deals with projects that prefer to accept contributed patches via e-mail.</p> <p>First, you'll probably want to clone the main repository, create a topic branch for the patch or patch series you're planning to contribute, and do your work there. The sequence looks basically like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git clone (url)
$ cd project
$ git checkout -b featureA
$ (work)
$ git commit
$ (work)
$ git commit
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You may want to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">rebase -i</code> to squash your work down to a single commit, or rearrange the work in the commits to make the patch easier for the maintainer to review — see Chapter 6 for more information about interactive rebasing.</p> <p>When your branch work is finished and you're ready to contribute it back to the maintainers, go to the original project page and click the "Fork" button, creating your own writable fork of the project. You then need to add in this new repository URL as a second remote, in this case named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">myfork</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git remote add myfork (url)
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You need to push your work up to it. It's easiest to push the remote branch you're working on up to your repository, rather than merging into your master branch and pushing that up. The reason is that if the work isn't accepted or is cherry picked, you don't have to rewind your master branch. If the maintainers merge, rebase, or cherry-pick your work, you'll eventually get it back via pulling from their repository anyhow:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git push myfork featureA
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>When your work has been pushed up to your fork, you need to notify the maintainer. This is often called a pull request, and you can either generate it via the website — GitHub has a "pull request" button that automatically messages the maintainer — or run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git request-pull</code> command and e-mail the output to the project maintainer manually.</p> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">request-pull</code> command takes the base branch into which you want your topic branch pulled and the Git repository URL you want them to pull from, and outputs a summary of all the changes you're asking to be pulled in. For instance, if Jessica wants to send John a pull request, and she's done two commits on the topic branch she just pushed up, she can run this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git request-pull origin/master myfork

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>The output can be sent to the maintainer—it tells them where the work was branched from, summarizes the commits, and tells where to pull this work from.</p> <p>On a project for which you're not the maintainer, it's generally easier to have a branch like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> always track <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">origin/master</code> and to do your work in topic branches that you can easily discard if they're rejected. Having work themes isolated into topic branches also makes it easier for you to rebase your work if the tip of the main repository has moved in the meantime and your commits no longer apply cleanly. For example, if you want to submit a second topic of work to the project, don't continue working on the topic branch you just pushed up — start over from the main repository's <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git checkout -b featureB origin/master
$ (work)
$ git commit
$ git push myfork featureB
$ (email maintainer)
$ git fetch origin
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Now, each of your topics is contained within a silo — similar to a patch queue — that you can rewrite, rebase, and modify without the topics interfering or interdepending on each other as in Figure 5-16.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0516.png Figure 5-16. Initial commit history with featureB work.</p> <p>Let's say the project maintainer has pulled in a bunch of other patches and tried your first branch, but it no longer cleanly merges. In this case, you can try to rebase that branch on top of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">origin/master</code>, resolve the conflicts for the maintainer, and then resubmit your changes:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git checkout featureA
$ git rebase origin/master
$ git push -f myfork featureA
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This rewrites your history to now look like Figure 5-17.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0517.png Figure 5-17. Commit history after featureA work.</p> <p>Because you rebased the branch, you have to specify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-f</code> to your push command in order to be able to replace the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">featureA</code> branch on the server with a commit that isn't a descendant of it. An alternative would be to push this new work to a different branch on the server (perhaps called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">featureAv2</code>).</p> <p>Let's look at one more possible scenario: the maintainer has looked at work in your second branch and likes the concept but would like you to change an implementation detail. You'll also take this opportunity to move the work to be based off the project's current <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch. You start a new branch based off the current <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">origin/master</code> branch, squash the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">featureB</code> changes there, resolve any conflicts, make the implementation change, and then push that up as a new branch:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git checkout -b featureBv2 origin/master
$ git merge --no-commit --squash featureB
$ (change implementation)
$ git commit
$ git push myfork featureBv2
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--squash</code> option takes all the work on the merged branch and squashes it into one non-merge commit on top of the branch you're on. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--no-commit</code> option tells Git not to automatically record a commit. This allows you to introduce all the changes from another branch and then make more changes before recording the new commit.</p> <p>Now you can send the maintainer a message that you've made the requested changes and they can find those changes in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">featureBv2</code> branch (see Figure 5-18).</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0518.png Figure 5-18. Commit history after featureBv2 work.</p> <h3 id="public-large-project">Public Large Project</h3> <p>Many larger projects have established procedures for accepting patches — you'll need to check the specific rules for each project, because they will differ. However, many larger public projects accept patches via a developer mailing list, so I'll go over an example of that now.</p> <p>The workflow is similar to the previous use case — you create topic branches for each patch series you work on. The difference is how you submit them to the project. Instead of forking the project and pushing to your own writable version, you generate e-mail versions of each commit series and e-mail them to the developer mailing list:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git checkout -b topicA
$ (work)
$ git commit
$ (work)
$ git commit
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Now you have two commits that you want to send to the mailing list. You use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git format-patch</code> to generate the mbox-formatted files that you can e-mail to the list — it turns each commit into an e-mail message with the first line of the commit message as the subject and the rest of the message plus the patch that the commit introduces as the body. The nice thing about this is that applying a patch from an e-mail generated with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">format-patch</code> preserves all the commit information properly, as you'll see more of in the next section when you apply these patches:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git format-patch -M origin/master
0001-add-limit-to-log-function.patch
0002-changed-log-output-to-30-from-25.patch
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">format-patch</code> command prints out the names of the patch files it creates. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-M</code> switch tells Git to look for renames. The files end up looking like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You can also edit these patch files to add more information for the e-mail list that you don't want to show up in the commit message. If you add text between the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">---</code> line and the beginning of the patch (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">lib/simplegit.rb</code> line), then developers can read it; but applying the patch excludes it.</p> <p>To e-mail this to a mailing list, you can either paste the file into your e-mail program or send it via a command-line program. Pasting the text often causes formatting issues, especially with "smarter" clients that don't preserve newlines and other whitespace appropriately. Luckily, Git provides a tool to help you send properly formatted patches via IMAP, which may be easier for you. I'll demonstrate how to send a patch via Gmail, which happens to be the e-mail agent I use; you can read detailed instructions for a number of mail programs at the end of the aforementioned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">Documentation/SubmittingPatches</code> file in the Git source code.</p> <p>First, you need to set up the imap section in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">~/.gitconfig</code> file. You can set each value separately with a series of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git config</code> commands, or you can add them manually; but in the end, your config file should look something like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>[imap]
  folder = "[Gmail]/Drafts"
  host = imaps://imap.gmail.com
  user = user@gmail.com
  pass = p4ssw0rd
  port = 993
  sslverify = false
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If your IMAP server doesn't use SSL, the last two lines probably aren't necessary, and the host value will be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">imap://</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">imaps://</code>. When that is set up, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git imap-send</code> to place the patch series in the Drafts folder of the specified IMAP server:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ cat *.patch |git imap-send
Resolving imap.gmail.com... ok
Connecting to [74.125.142.109]:993... ok
Logging in...

100% (2/2) done
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>At this point, you should be able to go to your Drafts folder, change the To field to the mailing list you're sending the patch to, possibly CC the maintainer or person responsible for that section, and send it off.</p> <p>You can also send the patches through an SMTP server. As before, you can set each value separately with a series of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git config</code> commands, or you can add them manually in the sendemail section in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">~/.gitconfig</code> file:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>[sendemail]
  smtpencryption = tls
  smtpserver = smtp.gmail.com
  smtpuser = user@gmail.com
  smtpserverport = 587
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>After this is done, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git send-email</code> to send your patches:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">

You'll learn how to be a benevolent dictator or integration manager.</p> <h2 id="maintaining-a-project">Maintaining a Project</h2> <p>In addition to knowing how to effectively contribute to a project, you'll likely need to know how to maintain one. This can consist of accepting and applying patches generated via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">format-patch</code> and e-mailed to you, or integrating changes in remote branches for repositories you've added as remotes to your project. Whether you maintain a canonical repository or want to help by verifying or approving patches, you need to know how to accept work in a way that is clearest for other contributors and sustainable by you over the long run.</p> <h3 id="working-in-topic-branches">Working in Topic Branches</h3> <p>When you're thinking of integrating new work, it's generally a good idea to try it out in a topic branch — a temporary branch specifically made to try out that new work. This way, it's easy to tweak a patch individually and leave it if it's not working until you have time to come back to it. If you create a simple branch name based on the theme of the work you're going to try, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">ruby_client</code> or something similarly descriptive, you can easily remember it if you have to abandon it for a while and come back later. The maintainer of the Git project tends to namespace these branches as well — such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">sc/ruby_client</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">sc</code> is short for the person who contributed the work. As you'll remember, you can create the branch based off your master branch like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git branch sc/ruby_client master
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Or, if you want to also switch to it immediately, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">checkout -b</code> command:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git checkout -b sc/ruby_client master
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Now you're ready to add your contributed work into this topic branch and determine if you want to merge it into your longer-term branches.</p> <h3 id="applying-patches-from-e-mail">Applying Patches from E-mail</h3> <p>If you receive a patch over e-mail that you need to integrate into your project, you need to apply the patch in your topic branch to evaluate it. There are two ways to apply an e-mailed patch: with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git apply</code> or with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git am</code>.</p> <h4 id="applying-a-patch-with-apply">Applying a Patch with apply</h4> <p>If you received the patch from someone who generated it with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git diff</code> or a Unix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">diff</code> command, you can apply it with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git apply</code> command. Assuming you saved the patch at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">/tmp/patch-ruby-client.patch</code>, you can apply the patch like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git apply /tmp/patch-ruby-client.patch
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This modifies the files in your working directory. It's almost identical to running a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">patch -p1</code> command to apply the patch, although it's more paranoid and accepts fewer fuzzy matches than patch. It also handles file adds, deletes, and renames if they're described in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git diff</code> format, which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">patch</code> won't do. Finally, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git apply</code> is an "apply all or abort all" model where either everything is applied or nothing is, whereas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">patch</code> can partially apply patchfiles, leaving your working directory in a weird state. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git apply</code> is overall much more paranoid than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">patch</code>. It won't create a commit for you — after running it, you must stage and commit the changes introduced manually.</p> <p>You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git apply</code> to see if a patch applies cleanly before you try actually applying it — you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git apply --check</code> with the patch:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git apply --check 0001-seeing-if-this-helps-the-gem.patch
error: patch failed: ticgit.gemspec:1
error: ticgit.gemspec: patch does not apply
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If there is no output, then the patch should apply cleanly. This command also exits with a non-zero status if the check fails, so you can use it in scripts if you want.</p> <h4 id="applying-a-patch-with-am">Applying a Patch with am</h4> <p>If the contributor is a Git user and was good enough to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">format-patch</code> command to generate their patch, then your job is easier because the patch contains author information and a commit message for you. If you can, encourage your contributors to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">format-patch</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">diff</code> to generate patches for you. You should only have to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git apply</code> for legacy patches and things like that.</p> <p>To apply a patch generated by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">format-patch</code>, you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git am</code>. Technically, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git am</code> is built to read an mbox file, which is a simple, plain-text format for storing one or more e-mail messages in one text file. It looks something like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">

Limit log functionality to the first 20
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This is the beginning of the output of the format-patch command that you saw in the previous section. This is also a valid mbox e-mail format. If someone has e-mailed you the patch properly using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git send-email</code>, and you download that into an mbox format, then you can point <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git am</code> to that mbox file, and it will start applying all the patches it sees. If you run a mail client that can save several e-mails out in mbox format, you can save entire patch series into a file and then use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git am</code> to apply them one at a time.</p> <p>However, if someone uploaded a patch file generated via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">format-patch</code> to a ticketing system or something similar, you can save the file locally and then pass that file saved on your disk to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git am</code> to apply it:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git am 0001-limit-log-function.patch
Applying: add limit to log function
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You can see that it applied cleanly and automatically created the new commit for you. The author information is taken from the e-mail's <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">From</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">Date</code> headers, and the message of the commit is taken from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">Subject</code> and body (before the patch) of the e-mail. For example, if this patch was applied from the mbox example I just showed, the commit generated would look something like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">

The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">Author</code> information is the individual who originally created the patch and when it was originally created.</p> <p>But it's possible that the patch won't apply cleanly. Perhaps your main branch has diverged too far from the branch the patch was built from, or the patch depends on another patch you haven't applied yet. In that case, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git am</code> process will fail and ask you what you want to do:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git am 0001-seeing-if-this-helps-the-gem.patch

When you have resolved this problem run "git am --resolved".
If you would prefer to skip this patch, instead run "git am --skip".
To restore the original branch and stop patching run "git am --abort".
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This command puts conflict markers in any files it has issues with, much like a conflicted merge or rebase operation. You solve this issue much the same way — edit the file to resolve the conflict, stage the new file, and then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git am --resolved</code> to continue to the next patch:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ (fix the file)
$ git add ticgit.gemspec

Applying: seeing if this helps the gem
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If you want Git to try a bit more intelligently to resolve the conflict, you can pass a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-3</code> option to it, which makes Git attempt a three-way merge. This option isn't on by default because it doesn't work if the commit the patch says it was based on isn't in your repository. If you do have that commit — if the patch was based on a public commit — then the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-3</code> option is generally much smarter about applying a conflicting patch:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>In this case, I was trying to apply a patch I had already applied. Without the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-3</code> option, it looks like a conflict.</p> <p>If you're applying a number of patches from an mbox, you can also run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">am</code> command in interactive mode, which stops at each patch it finds and asks if you want to apply it:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This is nice if you have a number of patches saved, because you can view the patch first if you don't remember what it is, or not apply the patch if you've already done so.</p> <p>When all the patches for your topic are applied and committed into your branch, you can choose whether and how to integrate them into a longer-running branch.</p> <h3 id="checking-out-remote-branches">Checking Out Remote Branches</h3> <p>If your contribution came from a Git user who set up their own repository, pushed a number of changes into it, and then sent you the URL to the repository and the name of the remote branch the changes are in, you can add them as a remote and do merges locally.</p> <p>For instance, if Jessica sends you an e-mail saying that she has a great new feature in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">ruby-client</code> branch of her repository, you can test it by adding the remote and checking out that branch locally:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git remote add jessica git://github.com/jessica/myproject.git
$ git fetch jessica
$ git checkout -b rubyclient jessica/ruby-client
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If she e-mails you again later with another branch containing another great feature, you can fetch and check out because you already have the remote setup.</p> <p>This is most useful if you're working with a person consistently. If someone only has a single patch to contribute once in a while, then accepting it over e-mail may be less time consuming than requiring everyone to run their own server and having to continually add and remove remotes to get a few patches. You're also unlikely to want to have hundreds of remotes, each for someone who contributes only a patch or two. However, scripts and hosted services may make this easier — it depends largely on how you develop and how your contributors develop.</p> <p>The other advantage of this approach is that you get the history of the commits as well. Although you may have legitimate merge issues, you know where in your history their work is based; a proper three-way merge is the default rather than having to supply a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-3</code> and hope the patch was generated off a public commit to which you have access.</p> <p>If you aren't working with a person consistently but still want to pull from them in this way, you can provide the URL of the remote repository to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git pull</code> command. This does a one-time pull and doesn't save the URL as a remote reference:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git pull git://github.com/onetimeguy/project.git
From git://github.com/onetimeguy/project
 * branch            HEAD       -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
Merge made by recursive.
</code></pre>  </div></div> <h3 id="determining-what-is-introduced">Determining What Is Introduced</h3> <p>Now you have a topic branch that contains contributed work. At this point, you can determine what you'd like to do with it. This section revisits a couple of commands so you can see how you can use them to review exactly what you'll be introducing if you merge this into your main branch.</p> <p>It's often helpful to get a review of all the commits that are in this branch but that aren't in your master branch. You can exclude commits in the master branch by adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--not</code> option before the branch name. For example, if your contributor sends you two patches and you create a branch called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">contrib</code> and applied those patches there, you can run this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">

    updated the gemspec to hopefully work better
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>To see what changes each commit introduces, remember that you can pass the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-p</code> option to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git log</code> and it will append the diff introduced to each commit.</p> <p>To see a full diff of what would happen if you were to merge this topic branch with another branch, you may have to use a weird trick to get the correct results. You may think to run this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git diff master
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This command gives you a diff, but it may be misleading. If your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch has moved forward since you created the topic branch from it, then you'll get seemingly strange results. This happens because Git directly compares the snapshots of the last commit of the topic branch you're on and the snapshot of the last commit on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch. For example, if you've added a line in a file on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch, a direct comparison of the snapshots will look like the topic branch is going to remove that line.</p> <p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> is a direct ancestor of your topic branch, this isn't a problem; but if the two histories have diverged, the diff will look like you're adding all the new stuff in your topic branch and removing everything unique to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch.</p> <p>What you really want to see are the changes added to the topic branch — the work you'll introduce if you merge this branch with master. You do that by having Git compare the last commit on your topic branch with the first common ancestor it has with the master branch.</p> <p>Technically, you can do that by explicitly figuring out the common ancestor and then running your diff on it:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git merge-base contrib master
36c7dba2c95e6bbb78dfa822519ecfec6e1ca649
$ git diff 36c7db
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>However, that isn't convenient, so Git provides another shorthand for doing the same thing: the triple-dot syntax. In the context of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">diff</code> command, you can put three periods after another branch to do a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">diff</code> between the last commit of the branch you're on and its common ancestor with another branch:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git diff master...contrib
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This command shows you only the work your current topic branch has introduced since its common ancestor with master. That is a very useful syntax to remember.</p> <h3 id="integrating-contributed-work">Integrating Contributed Work</h3> <p>When all the work in your topic branch is ready to be integrated into a more mainline branch, the question is how to do it. Furthermore, what overall workflow do you want to use to maintain your project? You have a number of choices, so I'll cover a few of them.</p> <h4 id="merging-workflows">Merging Workflows</h4> <p>One simple workflow merges your work into your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch. In this scenario, you have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch that contains basically stable code. When you have work in a topic branch that you've done or that someone has contributed and you've verified, you merge it into your master branch, delete the topic branch, and then continue the process. If we have a repository with work in two branches named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">ruby_client</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">php_client</code> that looks like Figure 5-19 and merge <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">ruby_client</code> first and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">php_client</code> next, then your history will end up looking like Figure 5-20.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0519.png Figure 5-19. History with several topic branches.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0520.png Figure 5-20. After a topic branch merge.</p> <p>That is probably the simplest workflow, but it's problematic if you're dealing with larger repositories or projects.</p> <p>If you have more developers or a larger project, you'll probably want to use at least a two-phase merge cycle. In this scenario, you have two long-running branches, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">develop</code>, in which you determine that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> is updated only when a very stable release is cut and all new code is integrated into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">develop</code> branch. You regularly push both of these branches to the public repository. Each time you have a new topic branch to merge in (Figure 5-21), you merge it into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">develop</code> (Figure 5-22); then, when you tag a release, you fast-forward <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> to wherever the now-stable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">develop</code> branch is (Figure 5-23).</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0521.png Figure 5-21. Before a topic branch merge.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0522.png Figure 5-22. After a topic branch merge.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0523.png Figure 5-23. After a topic branch release.</p> <p>This way, when people clone your project's repository, they can either check out master to build the latest stable version and keep up to date on that easily, or they can check out develop, which is the more cutting-edge stuff. You can also continue this concept, having an integrate branch where all the work is merged together. Then, when the codebase on that branch is stable and passes tests, you merge it into a develop branch; and when that has proven itself stable for a while, you fast-forward your master branch.</p> <h4 id="large-merging-workflows">Large-Merging Workflows</h4> <p>The Git project has four long-running branches: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">next</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">pu</code> (proposed updates) for new work, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">maint</code> for maintenance backports. When new work is introduced by contributors, it's collected into topic branches in the maintainer's repository in a manner similar to what I've described (see Figure 5-24). At this point, the topics are evaluated to determine whether they're safe and ready for consumption or whether they need more work. If they're safe, they're merged into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">next</code>, and that branch is pushed up so everyone can try the topics integrated together.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0524.png Figure 5-24. Managing a complex series of parallel contributed topic branches.</p> <p>If the topics still need work, they're merged into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">pu</code> instead. When it's determined that they're totally stable, the topics are re-merged into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> and are then rebuilt from the topics that were in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">next</code> but didn't yet graduate to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code>. This means <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> almost always moves forward, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">next</code> is rebased occasionally, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">pu</code> is rebased even more often (see Figure 5-25).</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0525.png Figure 5-25. Merging contributed topic branches into long-term integration branches.</p> <p>When a topic branch has finally been merged into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code>, it's removed from the repository. The Git project also has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">maint</code> branch that is forked off from the last release to provide backported patches in case a maintenance release is required. Thus, when you clone the Git repository, you have four branches that you can check out to evaluate the project in different stages of development, depending on how cutting edge you want to be or how you want to contribute; and the maintainer has a structured workflow to help them vet new contributions.</p> <h4 id="rebasing-and-cherry-picking-workflows">Rebasing and Cherry Picking Workflows</h4> <p>Other maintainers prefer to rebase or cherry-pick contributed work on top of their master branch, rather than merging it in, to keep a mostly linear history. When you have work in a topic branch and have determined that you want to integrate it, you move to that branch and run the rebase command to rebuild the changes on top of your current master (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">develop</code>, and so on) branch. If that works well, you can fast-forward your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">master</code> branch, and you'll end up with a linear project history.</p> <p>The other way to move introduced work from one branch to another is to cherry-pick it. A cherry-pick in Git is like a rebase for a single commit. It takes the patch that was introduced in a commit and tries to reapply it on the branch you're currently on. This is useful if you have a number of commits on a topic branch and you want to integrate only one of them, or if you only have one commit on a topic branch and you'd prefer to cherry-pick it rather than run rebase. For example, suppose you have a project that looks like Figure 5-26.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0526.png Figure 5-26. Example history before a cherry pick.</p> <p>If you want to pull commit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">e43a6</code> into your master branch, you can run</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git cherry-pick e43a6fd3e94888d76779ad79fb568ed180e5fcdf

 3 files changed, 17 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This pulls the same change introduced in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">e43a6</code>, but you get a new commit SHA-1 value, because the date applied is different. Now your history looks like Figure 5-27.</p> <p>Insert 18333fig0527.png Figure 5-27. History after cherry-picking a commit on a topic branch.</p> <p>Now you can remove your topic branch and drop the commits you didn't want to pull in.</p> <h3 id="tagging-your-releases">Tagging Your Releases</h3> <p>When you've decided to cut a release, you'll probably want to drop a tag so you can re-create that release at any point going forward. You can create a new tag as I discussed in Chapter 2. If you decide to sign the tag as the maintainer, the tagging may look something like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git tag -s v1.5 -m 'my signed 1.5 tag'

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If you do sign your tags, you may have the problem of distributing the public PGP key used to sign your tags. The maintainer of the Git project has solved this issue by including their public key as a blob in the repository and then adding a tag that points directly to that content. To do this, you can figure out which key you want by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">gpg --list-keys</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ gpg --list-keys

</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>Now that you have the contents of your key in Git, you can create a tag that points directly to it by specifying the new SHA-1 value that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">hash-object</code> command gave you:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git tag -a maintainer-pgp-pub 659ef797d181633c87ec71ac3f9ba29fe5775b92
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git push --tags</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">maintainer-pgp-pub</code> tag will be shared with everyone. If anyone wants to verify a tag, they can directly import your PGP key by pulling the blob directly out of the database and importing it into GPG:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git show maintainer-pgp-pub | gpg --import
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>They can use that key to verify all your signed tags. Also, if you include instructions in the tag message, running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git show &lt;tag&gt;</code> will let you give the end user more specific instructions about tag verification.</p> <h3 id="generating-a-build-number">Generating a Build Number</h3> <p>Because Git doesn't have monotonically increasing numbers like ‘v123' or the equivalent to go with each commit, if you want to have a human-readable name to go with a commit, you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git describe</code> on that commit. Git gives you the name of the nearest tag with the number of commits on top of that tag and a partial SHA-1 value of the commit you're describing:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git describe master
v1.6.2-rc1-20-g8c5b85c
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>This way, you can export a snapshot or build and name it something understandable to people. In fact, if you build Git from source code cloned from the Git repository, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git --version</code> gives you something that looks like this. If you're describing a commit that you have directly tagged, it gives you the tag name.</p> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git describe</code> command favors annotated tags (tags created with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-a</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">-s</code> flag), so release tags should be created this way if you're using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git describe</code>, to ensure the commit is named properly when described. You can also use this string as the target of a checkout or show command, although it relies on the abbreviated SHA-1 value at the end, so it may not be valid forever. For instance, the Linux kernel recently jumped from 8 to 10 characters to ensure SHA-1 object uniqueness, so older <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git describe</code> output names were invalidated.</p> <h3 id="preparing-a-release">Preparing a Release</h3> <p>Now you want to release a build. One of the things you'll want to do is create an archive of the latest snapshot of your code for those poor souls who don't use Git. The command to do this is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git archive</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git archive master --prefix='project/' | gzip &gt; `git describe master`.tar.gz
$ ls *.tar.gz
v1.6.2-rc1-20-g8c5b85c.tar.gz
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>If someone opens that tarball, they get the latest snapshot of your project under a project directory. You can also create a zip archive in much the same way, but by passing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">--format=zip</code> option to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git archive</code>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git archive master --prefix='project/' --format=zip &gt; `git describe master`.zip
</code></pre>  </div></div> <p>You now have a nice tarball and a zip archive of your project release that you can upload to your website or e-mail to people.</p> <h3 id="the-shortlog">The Shortlog</h3> <p>It's time to e-mail your mailing list of people who want to know what's happening in your project. A nice way of quickly getting a sort of changelog of what has been added to your project since your last release or e-mail is to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate">git shortlog</code> command. It summarizes all the commits in the range you give it; for example, the following gives you a summary of all the commits since your last release, if your last release was named v1.0.1:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge notranslate"><div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git shortlog --no-merges master --not v1.0.1
