h2. Helvetica is missing

This is the "@! I can't find file `Helvetica'.@" error, mainly due to the fact Helvetica is a proprietary font and thus potentially not installed on your OS.

However, you can select the name of the default font you do want to use by updating the @latex/config.yml@ file and changing:
* the @default@ entry to change the font for all books
* changing/adding a @font@ entry in your language of choice

For example:

<pre>
<code>
fr:
  font: Verdana
</code></pre> 

h2. For Ubuntu,The solution is:

Edit latex/config.yml,used fonts: *Ubuntu* for normal text and *DejaVu Sans Mono* for monospace
For example:
<pre><code>
default:
  font: Ubuntu
  bold: "{* Bold}"
  mono: DejaVu Sans Mono
  prechap: "Chapter "
  postchap: ""
  presect: "Section "
  postsect: ""
  dql: "“"
  dqr: "”"
  con: "Contents"
  fig: "Figure "
  tab: "Table "
  indent: "\\qquad"

Edit latex/config.yml,used fonts: *Nimbus Sans L* (@apt-get install tex-gyre@) for normal text and *DejaVu Sans Mono* for monospace
For example:
<pre><code>
default:
  font: Nimbus Sans L
  bold: "{* Bold}" 
  mono: DejaVu Sans Mono</code></pre>
